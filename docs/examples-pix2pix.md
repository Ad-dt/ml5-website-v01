Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial nets, or pix2pix, is a machine learning technique developed by 
[Isola et al](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) that learns how to map input images to output images.

You can train your own images following ~~[this tutorial]()~~. More on this soon! 

This example is using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
