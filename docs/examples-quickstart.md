Here you will find a collection of interactive examples using ml5.js. The examples are meant to serve as an introduction to the library and machine learning concepts.

The examples here use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to access live video, create DOM elements and draw into the canvas more easily. (ml5.js does not depend on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and you may also use it with vanilla JavaScript or other libraries.)

You can find the source for all of the examples with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and other libraries at the [github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples) repository.

All examples are self-contained and can be run independently. Libraries are loaded through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and certain examples (indicated in code comments) download a machine learning model from a "cloud" url.

If you need to run the examples offline you can download [the p5.js library](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.0/p5.min.js) and [ml5 library](https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js).

The url for the ml5.js library to copy into an index.html file is:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
