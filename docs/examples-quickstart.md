Here you will find a collection of interactive examples using ml5.js. The examples are meant to serve as an introduction to the library and machine learning concepts.

All examples here are using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to access the camera feed, create DOM elements and draw into the canvas more easily. (ml5.js does not depend on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and you can use it without it)

You can find a collection of different examples, with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and other libraries, in this url: [github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples)

All examples are self-contained and can be run independently. Libraries are loaded through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and certain examples (indicated in code comments) download a machine learning model from a "cloud" url.

If you need to run the examples offline you can download the p5.js libraries [here](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.5.16/p5.min.js) and ml5 library [here](https://unpkg.com/ml).

If you are looking just for a link to the ml5.js library to paste in your website, here you go:

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
