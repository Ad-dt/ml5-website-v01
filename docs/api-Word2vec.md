Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings<sup>[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)</sup>. This class allows you to perform vector operations on a given set of input vectors. You can use the pre-trained word models or you can train your own vector models following [this tutorial](#).

### Example

```javascript
// Create the classifier
const wordVectors = new ml5.Word2Vec('data/wordvecs10000.json', generate);

function generate() {
  // Find the closest word to 'rainbow'
  const nearest = wordVectors.nearest('rainbow', 1);

  // Find the average of two words
  const average = wordVectors.average(['red', 'green'], 1); // Should output yellow
}
```

## Constructor
  ```javascript
  Word2Vec(vectors, [callback])
  ```
  `vectors` - A JSON file containing valid vectors of N-dimension, loaded asynchronously.
  `callback` (optional) - A callback function that is executed once the model has loaded.

## Properties

  ```javascript
  .ready
  ```
  > Boolean value that specifies if the model has loaded.

  ```javascript
  .model
  ```
  > The model being used.

  ```javascript
  .modelSize
  ```
  > The size of the model being used.

  ```javascript
  .math
  ```
  > The environment Math element.

## Methods

  ```javascript
  .add(inputs, max)
  ```
  > Add a series of vectors. Returns the closest vector of that sum.

  `inputs` - An array of strings containing the inputs to be added

  `max` - The maximum results to return. Optional. Defaults to 1.


  ```javascript
  .subtract(inputs, max)
  ```
  > Subtract a series of vectors. Returns the closest vector of that sum.

  `inputs` - An array of strings containing the inputs to be subtracted.

  `max` - The maximum results to return. Optional. Defaults to 1.


  ```javascript
  .average(inputs, max)
  ```
  > Average a series of vectors. Returns the closest vector of that average.

  `inputs` - An array of strings containing the inputs to be averaged.

  `max` - The maximum results to return. Optional. Defaults to 1.

  ```javascript
  .nearest(input, max)
  ```
  > Find the nearest vector. Returns `max` array of values.

  `input` - The input vector string.

  `max` - The maximum results to return. Optional. Defaults to 10.

  ```javascript
  .getRandomWord()
  ```
  > Find a random word in the loaded model. Returns a string.

## Static Methods

  ```javascript
  addOrSubtract(model)
  ```
  > Utility method to add or subtract vectors.

  `model` - The model used.

  ```javascript
  nearest(model)
  ```
  > Finds the n-closest neighbors of a vector.

  `model` - The model used.
