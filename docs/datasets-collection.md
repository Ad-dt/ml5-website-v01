Sample ml5 datasets will be provided for easy use with the examples. They have been collected, cleaned, and in most cases labeled. They can be found in the [ml5-data-and-training](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-training/tree/master/datasets) github repository.

## Other common machine learning datasets

These datasets are often used in machine learning examples. While most are pre-processed, they may be formatted differently from the ml5 datasets.
