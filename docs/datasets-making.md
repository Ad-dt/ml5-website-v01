title: Making Your Own Datasets

So you want to make your own dataset! Here are some things to think about during this process.

## Introductory questions

### Where does data come from?

Data can be scraped from all over the internet, or from a specific site (like reddit, Twitter, or Flickr). It can be manually created by yourself, or by third-party data creation services (such as Crowdflower). It can be data you already have. And of course, much of the world's data comes from corporations. 

### Where do labels/tags come from? 

If the data is scraped from somewhere, the label is often the keyword used to search for the data (i.e. 'building' or 'tree'). The location of the data is also sometimes its label (i.e. the subreddit name if scraping from a site like reddit). Data can be manually labeled, or labeled using a third-party data tagging service. It can be labels you already have connected to your data. And of course, many labels and tags come from internal corporate taxonomies.

### Responsible data collection
think about whose data this is, whether they want you to scrape it
if there is a way you can ask permission and/or pay for it
representational harms
licensing
crowdsourcing

## Things to know for medium-specific datasets

### Images

Images often need to be resized to all be the same. 

### Music

As of now, music datasets for use with machine learning.
