ml5.js aims to make machine learning accessible to a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) with no other external dependencies.

The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample datasets with an emphasis on ethical computing. Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection and usage.

ml5.js is heavily inspired by [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Setup

Download the [latest version](https://unpkg.com/ml5) of ml5.js and save the following HTML file to your computer:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Getting Started with ml5.js</title>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5"></script>
    </head>

    <body>
      <script>

        // Your code will go here

      </script>
    </body>
  </html>
```

That's all! ðŸ’¥

## Creating a simple image classification example

Let's add something more to classify an image

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <head>
      <title>Getting Started with ml5.js</title>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5"></script>
    </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Image classification using Mobilenet</h1>
    <p>The MobileNet model labeled this as 
    <span id="result">...</span> with a confidence of
    <span id="probability">...</span></p>
    <img src="https://ml5js.org/docs/assets/img/bird.jpg" 
     crossorigin="anonymous" id="image" width="400">

    <script>
      // The image we want to classify
      const image = document.getElementById('image');
      // The result tag in the HTML
      const result = document.getElementById('result');
      // The probability tag in the HTML
      const probability = document.getElementById('probability');

      // Initialize the Image Classifier method with Mobilenet
      const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('Mobilenet');

      // Make a prediction with the selected image
      // This will return an array with a default of 10 options with their probabilities
      classifier.predict(image, function(results) {
        result.innerText = results[0].className;
        probability.innerText = results[0].probability.toFixed(4);
      });
    
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open it in a web browser and after a couple seconds of you should see something like this:
